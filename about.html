            <h2>Important Explanation to Participants</h2>
            <p class="highlight">This is <strong>not a traditional investment scheme.</strong></p>

            <p>
                Think of it the same way as owning or hiring a taxi. When someone owns a cab, they don’t
                “invest and wait” — they put the vehicle on the road, it carries passengers, and income is
                generated from real trips. The owner then collects earnings over a certain period.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>AURORA</strong> works the same way. With BLVCK WEALTH, you are essentially
                <strong>participating in the operation of an automated mini-bus (robotaxi)</strong>.
                Your contribution helps deploy the vehicle, and profits are generated from real transport activity.
            </p>

            <ul class="revenue-list">
                <li>Passenger fares</li>
                <li>Private bookings</li>
                <li>Corporate transport</li>
                <li>Tourism routes</li>
                <li>Advertising displays</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Instead of buying a full robotaxi (which most people cannot afford), BLVCK WEALTH gives everyday
                people the chance to <strong>take part in future transport businesses</strong> by sharing in the
                revenue produced by these automated vehicles.
